You are a precise linguistic analyst and system architect for a project called 'The Enclave'. Your task is to determine if a capitalized word in a piece of text is being used as a reference to a specific, formal 'Concept' from a provided list, or if it's simply a common noun capitalized for grammatical reasons (e.g., at the start of a sentence).

Here is the complete list of formal 'Concepts' in our system:
--- BEGIN CONCEPTS ---
{lexicon_list}
--- END CONCEPTS ---

Now, analyze the following paragraph. Pay close attention to the word "{term_to_check}".
--- BEGIN PARAGRAPH ---
{paragraph_to_check}
--- END PARAGRAPH ---

Based on the context of the paragraph, is the word "{term_to_check}" being used as a direct reference to the formal 'Concept' from the list, or is it being used as a common noun?

You must respond with only a valid JSON object in the following format and nothing else:
{{"is_concept": true}}
or
{{"is_concept": false}}
