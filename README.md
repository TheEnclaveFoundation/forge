# The Enclave Foundation: `foundry`

This repository is the **Internal Tooling & Automation Workshop** for The Enclave Foundation. It is a **monorepo** containing the source code, tests, and documentation for all the tools we use to build, test, and maintain our projects.

## Mandate

This repository houses the "scaffolding"â€”the powerful toolchain that enables our AI-driven development workflow. Everything needed to support the development process lives here.

## Structure

This is a managed monorepo.

-   **`apps/`**: Contains runnable applications, such as the `dispatcher` bot or our `sol-cli`.
-   **`packages/`**: Contains shared libraries and utilities, such as the `linter`, `delta-engine`, and `weaver`.
-   **`docs/`**: Contains high-level documentation about the tools themselves.

This monorepo structure allows for atomic refactoring, simplified dependency management, and a unified development environment.

It is the heart of our productivity. This test of the Delta Forge v4.0 was successful.
