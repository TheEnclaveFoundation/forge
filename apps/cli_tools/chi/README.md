# Chi (Î§) - The Orchestrator

`chi` is a planned application that will orchestrate the `lambda` and `psi` packages to provide a comprehensive health check of the Enclave's repositories.

**Status:** Not Implemented

Its purpose is to combine the deterministic checks from `lambda` with the qualitative judgments from `psi` into a single, unified report.

*(Full documentation will be available upon implementation.)*
