# Psi (Î¨) - The Oracle

The `psi` package is designed to interact with a high-capability LLM to provide nuanced, qualitative judgment on linter reports or other analysis tasks. It serves as the "Oracle" or "Philosopher" stage of the **[Integrated Adherence Protocol](../../../docs/Integrated-Adherence-Protocol.md)**.

**Status:** Specified, Not Implemented

Its purpose is to filter false positives from the `lambda` linter's report and assess content against more subtle principles, such as the Aesthetic Mandate.

*(Full documentation will be available upon implementation.)*
