# Forge Documentation

This directory is the central repository for detailed, conceptual, and protocol-level documentation for the `forge` toolchain. While individual tools have their own `README.md` for quick reference, this directory provides the deep dives.

## Core Protocols
-   **[Delta Manifest Protocol](./Delta.md)**: The specification for the structured text format used by the `delta` tool to apply filesystem changes.
-   **[Integrated Adherence Protocol](./Integrated-Adherence-Protocol.md)**: The master workflow for ensuring the philosophical and ethical integrity of the Architect's Codex using a two-stage process of Law (Linter) and Oracle (LLM).
-   **[Linter for the Soul](./Linter-for-the-Soul.md)**: The specification for the deterministic, programmatic tool that acts as the automated guardian of the Architect's Codex.

## Tool Documentation
-   **[Sigma](./Sigma.md)**: Documentation for the context snapshot tool.
-   **[Lambda](./Lambda.md)**: Documentation for the deterministic linter.
